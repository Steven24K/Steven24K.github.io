# stevenkoerts.nl (portfolio)

This is my personal website/blog/portfolio here I show the world what I am up to at the moment.

You can visit it at [stevenkoerts.nl](https://stevenkoerts.nl)

## Tech 

This website is made using plain `HTML`! Nothing fancy, just something that works. 


## Typescript support 

The project does support `Typescript` and `Sass`, using the build in compiler from Parcel.

> Keep your `Promise` and your types safe.


## Commands 

`yarn start` is all you need to get started.
